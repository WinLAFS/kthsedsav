1> add some more txt to the index poisoning attack in the fastrack
2> say that overnet is used in eMule
3> mention the two-phase publishing of the overlay
	and maybe how a search is done
4> explain a little bit better the stats for the evaluation of the heuristic
5> rename the solution slide
6> give the second way of attacking in the overnet
7> better explaining the methodology they use to classify the different 	versions
8> mention the total percentage for the validation of the heuristic
9> when mentioning the term decoy users, place in parenthesis (heavy users)

Conclusions:
-both vulnerable
-possible solutions
-DDoS attacks possible
